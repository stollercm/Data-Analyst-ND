The area wrangled for this project includes all of Cincinnati proper as 
well as many of its suburbs, some of which lie in Kentucky and Indiana. 
The region goes approximately as far north as Trenton, OH, as far east 
as Batavia, OH, as far south as Walton, KY, and as far west as the western 
edge of the  I-275 loop (in Indiana).

I selected this map area because I am a native Ohioan who has been living
in various parts of the Cincinnati area for about 10 years.
